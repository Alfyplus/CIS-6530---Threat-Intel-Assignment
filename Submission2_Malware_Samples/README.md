##

The malware samples in this repository were primarily collected from three open malware exchange platforms:

 - [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)
 - [vx underground](https://vx-underground.org/)
 - [InfoCon](https://infocon.org/)

To ensure provenance, only samples who's hashes could be verified were collected. Verification was done by cross referencing the malware's hash with IOCs in published attack analyses. This allows us to have a high degree of confidence that the samples collected correspond to the indicated APT groups.

The malware samples contained in the "Unassigned" folders are samples for which the APT group has not been identified, and for which no provenance is provided.

##

The zip file contains two folders, "Executable Malware" and "Other Payloads". Within these folders, there are folders named after APT groups (for example "APT28"). These group folders contain the malware samples collected for that group. Each group's folder also contains a file "README.txt", which documents file information, sample source, and hash provenance. The group folder named "Unassigned" contains malware for which the provenance and APT group was not determined.
