The malware samples in this repository were primarily collected from three open malware exchange platforms:

 - [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)
 - [vx underground](https://vx-underground.org/)
 - [InfoCon](https://infocon.org/)

To ensure provenance, only samples who's hashes could be verified were collected. Verification was done by cross referencing the malware's hash with IOCs in published attack analyses. This allows us to have a high degree of confidence that the samples collected correspond to the indicated APT groups.
